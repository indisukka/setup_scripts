# Arco Linux Setup Scripts
This is list of scripts i use to setup my system after a base [ArcoLinuxD](https://www.arcolinuxd.com/) install.

This installs xfce and openbox as the desktop/window manager. I'm planning to move to wayland mostly to [labwc](https://github.com/labwc/labwc) which is inspried by openbox and will update the the scripts as needed.

#### Notes
The scripts are based on setup scripts from ArcoLinuxD setup scripts [here](https://github.com/arcolinuxd/arco-openbox).
